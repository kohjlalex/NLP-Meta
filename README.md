## Getting Started
This is a repo that contains data scrapped from Meta pages of Singapore's two biggest Real Estate companies, PropertyGuruSg and 99dotco, as well as the NLP analysis done on them.

# Data scrapped from Meta Pages
Text data in the form of Meta posts were scrapped using the .py file found in [/directory]. You may also download the data files directly from the folder []

# Text Analysis was then carried out on the textual data to uncover 4 main objectives:
1) Frequency of competitor's posts 
2) The hashtags used for competitors' posts that had the highest reach
3) Topic Modelling to find out the common topics that competitors were posting about
4) Heatmap based on the frequency that the MRT stations appear in competitor's posts

# Findings
Please refer to the document [findings] for a summary of the findings
