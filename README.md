# Background
Our real estate client, PFS, is facing increasing competition and losing market share to their closest competitors Properygurusg and 99dotco) who are more savvy in navigating the online social media space.

# Business Objectives:
Our client wants to better understand their competitorsâ€™ online activities on Meta & how to compete more effectively in the online space, with the overarching goal of being able to present better service & remain the top choice for existing and potential clients

# Deliverables:
1.	Visualisation of frequency of competitor's posts
2.	Summary of the hashtags used for competitors' posts that had the highest reach
3.	List of common topics that competitors were posting about via Topic Modelling
4.	Heatmap based on the frequency that the MRT stations appeared in competitor's posts
5.	A data-driven, month-long social media calendar for our client that accounts for the activities of their online competitors. Do note that the findings from other ongoing projects (not included here) such as sentiment analysis from online forums (HardwareZone and Reddit) were also incorporated into the making of this calendar.
